# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

Bsc : SendMessage contract deployed to 0xc1f16766a0e56211F1d882DdC07d0F283aDdC921

polygon_mumbai : npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network polygon_mumbai
SendMessage contract deployed to 0xc1f16766a0e56211F1d882DdC07d0F283aDdC921
